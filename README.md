# Astrophotography FOV Simulator

A simulator of camera field of view (FOV) for astrophotography.

You only need to provide the **telescope focal length** and **camera sensor dimensions**.
The simulator will generate a mock photo of the astronomical object you are interested in.

The simulator is powered by and deployed via [`streamlit`](https://fovsim.streamlit.app/)!
